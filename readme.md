# Rust lang notes

This repo serves as a summarized reference to the things learned in Rust's programming language book ([The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)).

It's divided by chapter and sections. Every directory has their own Readme file with the summary and commmands of the lesson.
